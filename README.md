# login-page

 I have created a login page that incorporates real-time validation, providing an interactive and dynamic user experience. The form is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on responsive design and usability. Additionally, I have implemented smooth animations that enhance the visual appeal of the page and contribute to a seamless user experience. These animations make the form more engaging while ensuring users can easily navigate the login process.

# Extra points:

Real-Time Validation: Instant feedback is provided to the user as they fill out the form, ensuring that data is correct before submission. This feature helps prevent errors and enhances the overall user experience.
Responsive Design: The form is fully responsive, ensuring it works well across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Smooth Animations: The use of animations improves the visual flow, making the form feel more polished and modern.
User-Friendly Interface: With its intuitive layout and clear instructions, the form is easy to navigate, even for first-time users.
Security Focus: Although not detailed in the original description, real-time validation can help catch common input errors, contributing to a more secure login process.
